# Learn git-svn

Learning git-svn according to the original [Pro-Git online
book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v1/Git-and-Other-Systems-Git-and-Subversion).

First problem that arises is the fact that the original googlecode.com project,
which was at the address http://progit-example.googlecode.com/svn/ does not
exist anymore (since Google Code has been shut down). I found that it could be
retrieved at [this archive
address](https://storage.googleapis.com/google-code-archive-source/v2/code.google.com/progit-example/repo.svndump.gz).

Once downloaded, the following steps should be taken to create the svn
repository (it is actually faster than what is done in the original
description):
```
$ mkdir /tmp/test-svn
$ svnadmin create /tmp/test-svn
$ svnadmin load /tmp/testsvn/ < repo.svndump
```

After this we can already clone the svn repo into a git-svn repo:
```
$ git svn clone file:///tmp/test-svn -s
```

Note that in the description in the book at this point it seems like all
branches are automatically checked out locally, but this was not the case when I
ran it. In particular, I get the following:
```
$ git branch -a
* master
  remotes/origin/my-calc-branch
  remotes/origin/tags/2.0.2
  remotes/origin/tags/release-2.0.1
  remotes/origin/tags/release-2.0.2
  remotes/origin/tags/release-2.0.2rc1
  remotes/origin/trunk
```
You can get to the state described in the book by checking out all branches I
guess.
